# Covid-19 Detection in Chest X-Ray Images using Deep Neural Network
This is Deep Neural Network Model which used used to classify X-Ray images of Lung Parenchyma, whether they belongs to Covid Positive or Negative Case.
This Model uses X-Ray images of Lung Parenchyma as input and detect the Covid19 in Human Lung. 
It uses custom Network made using CNN and maximum accuracy is 99% on training and testing data.
